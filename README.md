# Introduction
Programs and data for the simulations of pure state estimation with adaptive Fisher-Symmetric measurements.

In the file `AdapFSM.py` are the necessary functions to perform the simulations of the performance of the estimation method. In `Simulations.ipynb` is the function created to perform the simulations and saving the generated data. In the folders *2_3*, *2_4*, *2_5* are saved the data files *.txt* of the simulations done with the ensamble division said in the names of each folder, the code that plot the graphs and the curve fit of the data.
